    "In the literature regarding sedimentary alkalinity generation there is a rather frequently used term - 'Irreversible alkalinity'.\n",
    "[Thomas et al. (2009)] defined it as alkalinity generated due to \"denitrification, and to some extent, sulfate reduction, ... if their products are buried or escape to the atmosphere\" and used it to describe high alkalinity values in the Wadden Sea.\n",
    "Different authors use 'Irreversible alkalinity' interchangably with 'Net alkalinity gain\" or just 'Net alkalinity' and propose different ways how to calculate it (Thomas et al. 2009, Hu et al. 2011, Brenner et al. 2016).\n",
    "'Irreversible alkalinity' utilize the idea that alkalinity generation in some areas can exceed alkalinity consumption and this uncompensated alkalinity can be filled with carbon dioxide.\n",
    "According to the textbook about seawater carbon chemistry by Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow (2001) \"the imbalance of the charge of the conservative ions is responsible for alkalinity\".\n",
    "Here conservative ions are ions of strong acids and bases, which concentrations are unaffected by changes in pH, pressure, or temperature (the same textbook by Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow (2001)).\n",
    "So we can assume that 'Irreversible alkalinity' is an increasing \"imbalance of the charge of the conservative ions\".\n",
    "If understand 'Irrreversible alkalinity' as uncompensated alkalinity filled with carbon dioxide it means that anions of carbon (weak) acid constantly replace conservative ions, what is hardly possible.\n",

    "Alkalinity generation in some coastal areas is well known.\n",
    "For example seasonal total alkalinity (TA) variations and yearly mean total alkalinity values in the German Bight (South-east of the North Sea) are much larger than in the center of the North Sea (Thomas et al., 2009; Voynova et al., 2019).\n",
    "These features can be caused by for example riverine influence, pelagic and benthic activities in the German Bight, pelagic and benthic activities in the adjoining Wadden Sea.\n",
    "In this study, we focus on the alkalinity release from the Wadden Sea.\n",
    "The Wadden Sea is a heterotrophic reservoir where organic matter (OM) oxidation prevails over OM production (van Beusekom et al., 1999), enhancing anaerobic alkalinity generation in coastal sediments.\n",
    "Also, tides induce additional mixing in sediments, which provides additional input of OM to sediments and therefore can, even more, enhance alkalinity fluxes through the sediment-water interface SWI (Beck et al., 2008).\n",
    "The goals of this study are to\n",
    "a) estimate the maximum value of TA that can be generated in the Wadden Sea sediments accounting for local OM input, and\n",
    "b) investigate which biogeochemical processes contribute to this value and if is it possible to describe it without implying a 'Irreversible alkalinity' notion."
